<h1>Lactation (Breastfeeding) Support</h1>
<p>Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed an infant and young child. Breastfeeding has many health benefits for infants, young children, and mothers. Compared with artifical feeding, like infant formula, breastfeeding reduces the risk for mothers and children to develop many health problems throughout life. For example, breastfed children are less likely to get sick enough to go in the hospital, have ear and lung infections, and have fewer digestive problems. Mothers who breastfeed are less likely to develop breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer, have lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and are less likely to develop diabetes.</p>

<p>Sometimes breastfeeding is easy, but often it is difficult. Signs of trouble include having nipple pain for more than several seconds after your baby latches, nipple bleeding, nipple compression after nursing, or your baby is not gaining enough weight. If you are having trouble with feeding, or are worried about how your feeding is going, let us help. Our pediatricians can help with basic feeding issues, and <a href="lisabretchespnp.html">Lisa Bretches</a>, our pediatric nurse practitioner, is a experienced lactation consultant. Please call us if you are having trouble with breastfeeding, for example, if you are having pain that last more than a few seconds after your baby latches.</p>

<p>If you are ever worried that your baby is not getting enough to eat, please make an appointment for a weight check so we can make sure your baby is eating well.</p>
