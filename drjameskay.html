After graduating from medical school, his wife's career brought him to southern California, where he completed his pediatrics residency at Loma Linda University. He has experience working in several pediatric practice and hospital environments, and enjoys teaching students who rotate through the office.</p>

<p>Dr. Kay's practice, especially well check-ups, emphasise preventative care, which includes providing support to families who choose to breastfeed their children, encouraging healthy eating and lifestyle choices, including daily physical activity. Dr. Kay completed supplemental training in breastfeeding during his residency (lactation educator traning).</p>

<p>Dr. Kay grew up in western Michigan. Prior to attending medical school, Dr. Kay was a pharmacist, with a Degree in Pharmacy from Ferris State University.</p>

<p>At home, Dr. Kay enjoys spending time with his wife and three children. He also enjoys computer technology, exercising, reading, learning guitar, and keeping-up with news and politics.</p>
